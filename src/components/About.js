        Hello, my name is Sebastian. I'm an aspiring web developer living in
        Helsinki, Finland. I studied Industrial Engineering and Management in
        Vasa, but my goal is to become a self taught programmer. As of this
        moment, I have base knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. Under
        the "projects" section you can find my completed projects, but for a
        closer look at my past and current projects, check out my{" "}
